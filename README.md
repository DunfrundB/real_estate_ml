# To Real Estate or not to Real Estate...?
A closer look at the 2008 Housing Crisis compared to the housing market today.

# Introduction
As a group our team decided an in depth analysis of the housing market is a very relavant topic for all team memebers.  There has not been a more important historical time period in the US housing market than the 2008 Housing Crisis.  Using predictive machine learning models and sentiment analysis tools our goal is to confirm the following hypothesis:  If the current housing market is at unsustaiable price levels, then a market correction is inevitable.  

# Machine Learning
Our exploring initially began in the Freddie Mac housing price database.  The goal was to get enough data on many different regions across the US in order to correctly train our models.  Freddie Mac had more than enough information than needed.  The data was so intricate they even had columns associated to the mortgage details on homes.  However we ran into issues loading the dataset into jupyterlab and GitHub.  The data set was too large therefore we had to find something else.  This is what ultimatley led us to the Quandl Zillow API.  Zillow had everything we needed, historical housing prices, regions, different size houses.  This simple API tool let us create a dataset for the specific regions we wanted to take a look at.  Our best bet for training models was selecting a dataframe that includes data from the top 30 regions in the US.

# Conclusion
Thourough analysis and use of different machine learning tools a conclusion was acheived in regards to our current Housing Market.  Public sentiment is a finicky subject but our tools showed us that sentiment is at the nuetral status with a heavy lean towards negative.  According to our survey analysis an extreme shift in public feelings has been trending toward negativity, the public thinks it is a good time to sell and that the economy is headed toward a crash.  Finally our machine learning models have been trained & tested with historical data.  The prediction models show that housing prices are increasing across the board.  The Zillow API tool only had data leading up to 5-31-21. We feel that an ongoing analysis of these models will help the user show downward trends in the market.  More time and data are needed to correctly show a housing market correction.  Our findings display a clear message, all signs point towards a negative public feeling but until housing prices start going down there will be no market correction.

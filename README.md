# To Real Estate or not to Real Estate...?
A closer look at the 2008 Housing Crisis compared to the housing market today.

# Introduction
As a group our team decided an in depth analysis of the housing market is a very relavant topic for all team memebers.  There has not been a more important historical time period in the US housing market than the 2008 Housing Crisis.  Using predictive machine learning models and sentiment analysis tools our goal is to confirm the following hypothesis:  If the current housing market is at unsustaiable price levels, then a market correction is inevitable.  

# Machine Learning
Our exploring initially began in the Freddie Mac housing price database.  There was a lot of good information but due to project scope and timeframe we ultimatley decided to utilize the Quandl Zillow API.  



# Conclusion
Thourough analysis and use of different machine learning tools a conclusion was acheived in regards to our current Housing Market.  Public sentiment is a finicky subject but our tools showed us that sentiment is at the nuetral status with a heavy lean towards negative.  According to our survey analysis an extreme shift in public feelings has been trending toward negativity, the public thinks it is a good time to sell and that the economy is headed toward a crash.  Finally our machine learning models have been trained & tested with historical data.  The prediction models show that housing prices are DECREASING across the board.  Our findings display a clear message, all signs point towards a market correction and our hypothesis was proven correct.
